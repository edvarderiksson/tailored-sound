hello readers!

Originally, we planned on having two main search modes: 'mood' and 'word'

The idea was that we were gonna have additional search fields for each namel:

Genres to include

Genres to exclude

Year

This iwas relatively easy to implement for the word search. Just make the API
call and include the other search terms in the string. However, the mood
search, searched playlists objects. HAving these search terms for the mood
searched too assumed that the playlist object would include these
possibilities or if not, it could be possible to iterate through the track
objects and search for year and genre in the objects.

As it turned out, it was only possible to search these terms as queries. My
assumption about the searches was incorrect and so we had to redisgn the
interface to include only mood (and instead work on improving the playlist
search) for the mood mode but and onl keep the functionalities for the word
search. 

Instead we are thinking of adding different ways to customize the mood search.
Some ideas include audio features, top listened function, less listened
function and mixed.

See how it goes
